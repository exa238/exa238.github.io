          <h3>Background</h3>

          <p>Malawi shares its name with the Chewa word for flames and is linked to the Maravi people from whom the Chewa language originated. The Maravi settled in what is now Malawi around <time datetime="1400">1400</time> during one of the later waves of Bantu migration across Central and Southern Africa. Several of Malawi’s ethnic groups trace their origins to different Maravi lineages</p>

          <p>A powerful Maravi kingdom, established around <time datetime="1500">1500,</time> reached its zenith around <time datetime="1700">1700</time>, when it controlled what is now Southern and Central Malawi as well as portions of neighboring Mozambique and Zambia before beginning to decline because of destabilization from the escalating global trade in enslaved people. In the early 1800s, widespread conflict in Southern Africa displaced various ethnic Ngoni groups, some of which moved into Malawi and further undermined the Maravi.</p>

          <p>Members of the Yao ethnic group - which had long traded with Malawi from Mozambique - introduced Islam and began to settle in Malawi in significant numbers the mid-1800s; in the late 1800s, members of the Lomwe ethnic group also moved into southern Malawi from Mozambique. British missionary and trading activity increased in the area around Lake Nyasa in the mid-1800s, and Britain declared a protectorate, called British Central Africa, over what is now Malawi in 1891 and eliminated various political entities that sought to retain their autonomy over the subsequent decade.</p>

          <p>The British renamed the territory Nyasaland in <time datetime="1907">1907</time> and it was part of the colonial Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland - including present-day Zambia and Zimbabwe - from <time datetime="1953">1953</time> to <time datetime="1963">1963</time> before gaining independence as Malawi in <time datetime="1964">1964</time>.</p>

          <p>Hastings Kamuzu Banda served as prime minister at independence and, when the country became a republic in <time datetime="1966">1966</time>, he became president. He later instituted one-party rule under his Malawi Congress Party<abbr title="Malawi Congress Party"> M.C.P</abbr> and was declared president for life. After three decades of one-party rule, the country held multiparty presidential and parliamentary elections in <time datetime="1994">1994</time> under a provisional constitution that came into full effect the following year.</p>

          <p>Bakili Muluzi of the United Democratic Front<abbr title="United Democratic Front"> U.D.F.</abbr> party became the first freely elected president of Malawi when he defeated Banda at the polls in <time datetime="1994">1994</time>; he won reelection in <time datetime="1999">1999</time>. President Bingu wa Mutharika was elected in <time datetime="2004">2004</time> and subsequently started his own party, the Democratic Progressive Party<abbr title="Democratic Progressive Party"> D.P.P.</abbr>, in <time datetime="2005">2005</time>. Mutharika was reelected to a second term in 2009.</p>

          <p>He died abruptly in <time datetime="2012">2012</time> and was succeeded by Vice President Joyce Banda, who had earlier started her own party, the People's Party. Mutharika's brother, Peter Mutharika, defeated Banda in the election in <time datetime="2014">2014</time>. Peter Mutharika was reelected in a disputed election in <time datetime="2019">2019</time> that resulted in countrywide protests.</p>

          <p>The courts ordered a new the election, and in <time datetime="2020">2020</time> Lazarus Chakwera of the <abbr title="Malawi Congress Party">M.C.P.</abbr> was elected president after defeating Mutharika as head of a coalition of opposition parties. Population growth, increasing pressure on agricultural lands, corruption, and the scourge of HIV/AIDS pose major problems for Malawi.</p>

          <h3>Food Insecurity</h3>
          <p>Severe localized food insecurity: due to reduced incomes - nationally, cereal production is estimated at a bumper high in 2021, which is expected to result in average to above‑average household cereal supplies and thus improvements in food security; despite the good food supply situation, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to curb access to food due to reduced incomes</p>
