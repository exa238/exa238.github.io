    <h2>Getting Into Indie Gaming</h2>
      <p>Emily has enjoyed gaming since she was young. However, during the summer of 2020, she has discovered the world of indie gaming and has found some great titles that she plays almost every day.</p>

      <p>She recommends that any person who is interested in gaming try finding a platform they enjoy. Then, find a specified genre of interest–– as many platforms have committed themselves to certain titles.</p>

      <p>PC gaming platforms like Steam can be especially helpful as they usually provide early access or trial runs of games that are usually available for free or at a discounted price. This way, if the gamer does not know which genre they enjoy yet, they can experiment in an affordable way.</p>
