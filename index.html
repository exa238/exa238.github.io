        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi I'm Emily. I've been a vegan for over 3 years and have a passion for yummy, flavorful food. I share plant-powered recipes with a focus on not only flavor, but compassion for animals. I believe vegan food doesn't have to be bland and can be just as enjoyable as any non-vegan alternative. </p>

        <h2>About the Recipes</h2>
        <p>Each recipe focuses on cruelty free, delicious cooking. I included 3 of my all time favorite recipes that I cook and enjoy regularly and hope you can enjoy them as well.</p>
