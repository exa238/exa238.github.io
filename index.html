    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi I'm Emily. I've been a vegan for over 3 years and have a passion for yummy, flavorful food. I share plant-powered recipes with a focus on not only flavor, but compassion for animals. I believe vegan food doesn't have to be bland and can be just as enjoyable as any non-vegan alternative. </p>
